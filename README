## Neighborhood Map project



### What I learned doing the map project:

1. How to build AJAX calls.
2. Javascript Design Patterns, including basic refactoring and separation of concerns. 
3. Goole Maps API.


### Files included: 

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the Map.
* **js/script.js**: Contains helper code needed to format and build the map. 
* **style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: The GitHub readme file.
* and some images in the images directory.

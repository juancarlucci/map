## Neighborhood Map project



### What I learned doing the map project:

1. How to build AJAX calls.
2. Javascript Design Patterns, including basic refactoring and separation of concerns. 
3. Goole Maps API.

### How to use the map

You will see a map of the San Francisco Bay Area, with markers for five restaruants that use real butter in their menu.
On the left hand panel you will find the list of restaurants, a search bar, a "Cool things near:" section, and some comments on the goodness of butter.
Click on the marker or the list of five restaruants to get more detaield information via an infowindow (google API).
You will also see a section on the left panel that shows "Cool things near:" your selected restaurant. This is done via a wikipedia API
